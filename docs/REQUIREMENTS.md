# Requirements

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Vietnamese TTS API service.

## Functional Requirements

### Core TTS Functionality

- The system must be able to convert Vietnamese text to speech with high-quality audio output.
- The system must support both file-based and streaming audio output endpoints.
- The system must allow for adjusting voice parameters including noise scale and noise weight for audio quality tuning.
- The system must support async streaming with in-memory buffering for optimal performance.

### API Endpoints

- **`/tts`**: Must provide file-based TTS synthesis returning downloadable WAV audio files (query-only API)
- **`/tts/stream`**: Must provide streaming TTS synthesis for real-time audio playback (query-only API)
- Both endpoints must support request validation and parameter customization via query parameters only
- No POST endpoints implemented - all functionality available through GET requests with query parameters

### Performance Requirements

- The system must implement in-memory caching (LRU strategy) to minimize processing time for repeated requests
- Cache keys must be generated from text content and synthesis parameters
- The system must handle concurrent requests efficiently

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- The system must have low latency (< 2 seconds for synthesis of average text length)
- The system must be able to handle a high volume of requests (100+ concurrent requests)
- Audio synthesis must be optimized for minimal CPU and memory usage

### Reliability

- The system must maintain stable operation under varying load conditions
- Audio output must be consistent and free of artifacts
- Error handling must be robust with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Deployment and Maintenance

- The system must be easy to deploy and maintain with container support
- Configuration must be externalized via YAML files
- Logging must be structured and configurable with multiple output destinations
- Dependencies must be managed with version pinning for reproducible builds
- Reproducible builds via pixi.toml dependency management

### Security

- API endpoints must validate all input parameters
- File system access must be restricted to configured directories only
- The system must not expose sensitive configuration information in error responses
